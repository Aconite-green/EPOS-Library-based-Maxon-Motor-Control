## Project Overview

In this project, we use the EPOS4 controller and DXL motor provided by Maxon Motor to perform position control (Profile Position Mode) and velocity control (Profile Velocity Mode) with the CAN protocol. The code is written in a C++ environment in Visual Studio, consisting of three files: DeviceController.cpp, DeviceController.h, and main.cpp.

## Technology Stack

- Language: C++
- Development Environment: Visual Studio
- Libraries: Definitions.h, EposCmd64.dll, EposCmd64.lib (provided by Maxon Motor)
- Protocol: CAN
