## Project Overview

In this project, we use the EPOS4 controller and DXL motor provided by Maxon Motor to perform position control (Profile Position Mode) and velocity control (Profile Velocity Mode) with the CAN protocol. The code is written in a C++ environment in Visual Studio, consisting of three files: DeviceController.cpp, DeviceController.h, and main.cpp.

## Technology Stack

- Language: C++
- Development Environment: Visual Studio
- Libraries: Definitions.h, EposCmd64.dll, EposCmd64.lib (provided by Maxon Motor)
- Protocol: CAN
- Hardware:
  - CAN Interface: CAN HS/FD Interface NI-XNET USB-8502
  - EPOS4 Controller: EPOS4 Compact 50/15 CAN, Digital Position Controller, 15 A, 10 - 50 VDC (Product No. 520886)
  - DXL Motor: DCX32L GB KL 48V
